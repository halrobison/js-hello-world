/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log("Hello, World.");

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed. (Success)
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them? (Error)
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")? (Must use both to open and close, but had success with " and '.)
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;. (Success)
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together). (Success if number is placed in parens, i.e., '2'. Can do arithmetic by removing quotation marks!)
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other. (Success)
   7. Print two messages on the same line. (Error with multiple quoted phrases in one line)
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore". (Error)
   9. Other. You choose!
